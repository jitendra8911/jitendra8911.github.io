This project is developed as part of training program at Egen Solutions Inc. The reason this project is so special is because
this is my first ever angular JS project. While frontend is written in angular, the backend is written in Java.

As the name indicates, this application lets user reserve a table at a restaurant. Some of the complex features I have
implemented are customer table reservation, updating existing reservation, admin view seating area, display modal popups for
user confirmation, update settings, update profile, view contacts, view past reservations, filters and sorting to table views.

The code is available at [github](https://github.com/jitendra8911/RestaurantReservationSystem_with_Angular){:target="_blank}
and the complete log of updates I made is available [here](https://github.com/jitendra8911/RestaurantReservationSystem_with_Angular/blob/master/Notes){:target="_blank"}
