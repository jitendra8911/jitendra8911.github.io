This project is about a programming contest I took part of in December 2020. It is a series of puzzles starting from December 1 through 25.
The complexity of the problems gradually increase as the days progress. It was undoubtedly one of the toughest contest I have ever been part of

<!--more-->

Every day 2 problems are unlocked and there is no fixed time to complete the puzzles. You can submit them at your own convenience.
But one thing to remember is that if you lag behind especially in the early stages, then it will be tough to pick up as the complexity
in the problems increases exponentially. Special mention should go to day 20, which was arguably one of the toughest problem I solved is my life.
I have written an article about it here [Advent of Code day 20]({% post_url docs/2021-01-30-advent-of-code-2020-day20 %}).

The source code for this contest is available [here](https://github.com/jitendra8911/advent-of-code){:target="_blank"}.
