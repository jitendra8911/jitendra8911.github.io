This current website you are in is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"}. 
According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_(software)){:target="_blank"}

>Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, projector organization sites

Earlier I had a personal website which was built using Drupal which is a content management system hosted in Bluehost.
But unfortunately I lost access to it. So I had to rebuild my website. I was looking into which framework will best suite for my
static website and I ended up using Jekyll and so far I had a good experience using it in maintaining my pages.

The source code for this website is available [here](https://github.com/jitendra8911/jitendra8911.github.io){:target="_blank"}.
