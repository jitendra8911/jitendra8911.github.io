[Advent of code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/20) day 20th problem arguably the most hardest problem I have ever solved
both in terms of complexity and also time taken to get the final output. If you want to know
more about why this was the hardest problem, various barriers I faced while solving the problem and how I have overcome barriers,
please continue reading this article. It is going to be a fun ride and a worth reading.

## Advent of Code

In the month of December 2020, I have participated in a programming contest called [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) which is created by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl), 
with the recommendation from my colleague. Every year Eric creates problems set that covers topics such as regular expressions,
matrix operations, bitwise operations, recursive functions, depth first and breadth first search, mathematical problems such as Chinese Remainder Theorem,
binary search tree, stacks, queues, string combinations and permutations, importance of double-precision floating-point,
linked list representation as an array, so on and so forth. The contest opens from December 1st through 25th. I strongly
recommend this challenge to anyone who is 

It was a fantastic experience for me getting to solve some of the toughest algorithmic problems I have ever come across.
One of the the problem which is the topic of the article is my favorite and the most challenging algorithmic problem I ever tackled.
It taught me so many things apart from technical perspective such as how to be patient solving tough problems, how to
strategically arrive to a solution, how helpful is divide and conquer approach among others. 

In the coming sections I am going to introduce the problem, challenges I faced at every tiny step I made and how
I have overcome those challenges to reach the end of tunnel!
