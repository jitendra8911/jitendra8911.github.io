Sunlight visible by human eye is made up of rainbow colors namely
VIBGYOR (Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Red).

A color that an object, or a living thing (such as plants) appears to have is the wavelength that it reflects after absorbing the remaining wavelengths
In this case, plants reflects green wavelength and absorbs the remaining wavelengths of light. Therefore, plants appear to be green.
