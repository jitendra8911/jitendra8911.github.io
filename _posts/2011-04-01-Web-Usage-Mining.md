This project is about mining web usage patterns of my undergraduate college website and finding frequent associated and most probable
subsequent page going to be visited by the students/surfers. Finally this information can be used by website manager to improve the
website experience for users by personalizing and web reorganizing.

I used apriory algorithm to find out frequently visited and associated web paths students/surfers. The useful pattern we found out was
that when students visit home->placements => they will most likely visit 2011-placements page.
